# Miniature Combined Privacy Block Lists
  
**You have found CPBL-Mini**
  
These are the *mini* editions of my block lists, for less capable devices and those who need block lists that are just a bit more lenient (to accomodate a wider variety of platforms and some edge cases). Here, you will find significantly slimmed-down versions of the [standard hosts file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/master/MiniLists/mini-newhosts.hosts); the [IPv6-only hosts file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/master/MiniLists/mini-newhosts-IPv6.hosts); the [dual stack hosts file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/master/MiniLists/mini-newhosts-Dual.hosts); the [standard optimized Windows hosts file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/master/MiniLists/NoFormatting/mini-opt-win.hosts); the [dual stack optimized Windows hosts file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/master/MiniLists/NoFormatting/mini-opt-win-Dual.hosts); the [PAC filter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/master/MiniLists/mini-pac-done.js), and the [uBO/ABP filter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/master/MiniLists/cpbl-abp-mini.txt).
  
Just like my main lists, there are *no-formatting* versions in the [NoFormatting](https://github.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/tree/master/MiniLists/NoFormatting) sub-directory as well, such as a [plain list of blocked domains](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/master/MiniLists/NoFormatting/mini-BlacklistedDomains.txt), an [optimized wildcard blacklist](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/master/MiniLists/NoFormatting/mini-cpbl-wildcard-blacklist.txt), a [dnsmasq blacklist](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/master/MiniLists/NoFormatting/cpbl-mini-dnsmasq.txt), and a [tld-compressed list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/master/MiniLists/NoFormatting/cpbl-mini-ctld.txt) of blocked domains. Here's a table:  

| TLD-Optimized |

| [**ABP**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/master/MiniLists/cpbl-abp-mini.txt) ǁ [**DNSMasq**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/master/MiniLists/NoFormatting/cpbl-mini-dnsmasq.txt) ǁ [**Domains**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/master/MiniLists/NoFormatting/cpbl-mini-ctld.txt) ǁ [**Wildcards**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/master/MiniLists/NoFormatting/mini-cpbl-wildcard-blacklist.txt) ǁ [**PAC**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/master/MiniLists/mini-pac-done.js) |

| Traditional |

| [**Standard Hosts**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/master/MiniLists/mini-newhosts.hosts) ǁ [**Windows Hosts**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/master/MiniLists/NoFormatting/mini-opt-win.hosts) ǁ [**Domains**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/master/MiniLists/NoFormatting/mini-BlacklistedDomains.txt) |

These lists will obviously not block as much content as the main lists, but they will still block *a whole lot*, thus significantly improving your experience on the world wide web.
  
Basically, if you're using a serious toaster, these lists are for you!

It should be noted that all content in this specific directory (`MiniLists`) falls under a separate license ([the WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/txt/copying/)).
