# Miniature Combined Privacy Block Lists
  
**You have found CPBL-Mini**
  
These are the *mini* editions of my block lists, for less capable devices. Here, you will find significantly slimmed-down versions of the [standard hosts file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/master/MiniLists/mini-newhosts.hosts); the [IPv6-only hosts file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/master/MiniLists/mini-newhosts-IPv6.hosts); the [dual stack hosts file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/master/MiniLists/mini-newhosts-Dual.hosts); the [standard optimized Windows hosts file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/master/MiniLists/NoFormatting/mini-opt-win.hosts); the [dual stack optimized Windows hosts file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/master/MiniLists/NoFormatting/mini-opt-win-Dual.hosts); the [PAC filter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/master/MiniLists/mini-pac-done.js), and the [uBO/ABP filter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/master/MiniLists/cpbl-abp-mini.txt).
  
Just like my main lists, there are *no-formatting* versions in the [NoFormatting](https://github.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/tree/master/MiniLists/NoFormatting) sub-directory as well.
  
These lists will obviously not block as much content as the main lists, but they will still block *a whole lot*, thus significantly improving your experience on the world wide web.
  
Basically, if you're using a serious toaster, these lists are for you!

It should be noted that all content in this specific directory (`MiniLists`) falls under a separate license ([the WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/txt/copying/)).
