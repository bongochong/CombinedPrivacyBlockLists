# Hosts Files Generated from Popular AdBlock Plus-compatible Subscriptions
Within this directory are relatively light-weight lists converted to the hosts format from popular AdBlock Plus-compatible subscriptions. They are as follows:

- [EasyList Desktop Hosts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/master/ABP2Hosts/easylist_desktop-hosts.txt) - This hosts file contains very useful entries for blocking general advertising, trackers, and malware. It is generated from the following EasyList & EasyPrivacy filter lists: [1](https://github.com/easylist/easylist/blob/master/easylist/easylist_adservers.txt); [2](https://github.com/easylist/easylist/blob/master/easylist/easylist_thirdparty.txt); [3](https://github.com/easylist/easylist/blob/master/easyprivacy/easyprivacy_trackingservers.txt); [4](https://github.com/easylist/easylist/blob/master/easyprivacy/easyprivacy_thirdparty.txt); [5](https://github.com/easylist/easylist/blob/master/easyprivacy/easyprivacy_trackingservers_international.txt); [6](https://github.com/easylist/easylist/blob/master/easyprivacy/easyprivacy_thirdparty_international.txt); [7](https://easylist-downloads.adblockplus.org/advblock.txt); [8](https://easylist-downloads.adblockplus.org/easylistchina.txt); [9](https://easylist-downloads.adblockplus.org/indianlist.txt); [10](https://easylist.to/easylistgermany/easylistgermany.txt); [11](https://filters.adavoid.org/ultimate-security-filter.txt).

- [AdGuard Mobile Hosts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/master/ABP2Hosts/adguard_mobile-hosts.txt) - This hosts file contains very useful entries for blocking *mobile* advertising, trackers, and malware. It is generated from the following AdGuard filter lists: [1](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/master/MobileFilter/sections/adservers.txt); [2](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/master/SpywareFilter/sections/mobile.txt); in addition to the mobile ad-block list from [AdAway](https://adaway.org/hosts.txt), for good measure.

- [AdGuard Desktop Hosts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/master/ABP2Hosts/adguard_desktop-hosts.txt) - This hosts file contains very useful entries for blocking general advertising, trackers, and malware. It is generated from the following AdGuard filter lists: [1](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/master/EnglishFilter/sections/adservers.txt); [2](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/master/EnglishFilter/sections/adservers_firstparty.txt); [3](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/master/SpywareFilter/sections/tracking_servers.txt); [4](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/master/EnglishFilter/sections/cryptominers.txt); [5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/master/SpywareFilter/sections/tracking_servers_firstparty.txt); [6](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/master/EnglishFilter/sections/foreign.txt); [7](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/master/RussianFilter/sections/adservers.txt); [8](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/master/RussianFilter/sections/adservers_firstparty.txt); [9](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/master/TurkishFilter/sections/adservers.txt); [10](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/master/TurkishFilter/sections/adservers_firstparty.txt); [11](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/master/ChineseFilter/sections/adservers.txt).

- [AdGuard DNS Hosts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/master/ABP2Hosts/adguard_dns-hosts.txt) - This hosts file is based on the filter which is used to block ads, trackers and other malicious content on AdGuard's DNS servers. Good for both desktop and mobile. It is generated from [this AdGuard filter list](https://adguardteam.github.io/AdGuardSDNSFilter/Filters/filter.txt).

- [Spam404 Hosts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/master/ABP2Hosts/spam_404-hosts.txt) - This hosts file is based on the two filters maintained by the [fine folks from Spam404](https://github.com/Spam404/lists). It mainly blocks scams and forum spam domains. It can be used on its own, but is best treated as a supplement to more comprehensive lists.

- [Piperun's IP-Logger Hosts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/master/ABP2Hosts/piperun-hosts.txt) - This is a hosts file based on the [AdBlock Plus filter provided by Piperun](https://github.com/piperun/iploggerfilter/blob/master/filterlist), which is meant to block connections to sites whose sole purpose is logging the IP addresses of visitors.

- [Disconnect Consolidated Hosts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/master/ABP2Hosts/disconnect_consolidated.txt) - This is a cleaned up and consolidated hosts file derived from all the *simple* block lists provided by Disconnect.me: [1](https://s3.amazonaws.com/lists.disconnect.me/simple_ad.txt); [2](https://s3.amazonaws.com/lists.disconnect.me/simple_tracking.txt); [3](https://s3.amazonaws.com/lists.disconnect.me/simple_malvertising.txt); [4](https://s3.amazonaws.com/lists.disconnect.me/simple_malware.txt).  

These will be updated at least once a week. They are compiled via fetching the filter lists with curl and piping them through a series of parsing commands (**which are subject to frequent changes out of necessity**) to remove content that is incompatible with hosts files, then are merged, sorted, and de-duped. I am focused on ensuring that no false-positives end up in these lists, so my routines can be relatively aggressive in avoiding that. This ensures that these specific hosts lists do *not* break important functionality on widely visited sites. Enjoy.
